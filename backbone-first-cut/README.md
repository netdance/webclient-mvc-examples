# JQProduct - sample thin server impl built with vanilla Backbone

I wrote this app second in my explorations, and used it as a way to get a feel for backbone.

It is NOT complete as of yet, and is full of both architectural and functional bugs.

## Install and see it run

download [qedserver](http://qedserver.napcs.com/) , then install the repo in the server's public directory.

run `bower install` to add the runtime dependencies. (Don't have bower?  install it with npm first.)

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html) and everything should be pretty self explanitory from there.
