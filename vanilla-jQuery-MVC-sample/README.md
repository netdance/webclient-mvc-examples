# JQProduct - sample thin server impl built with vanilla jQuery

I wrote this primarily to get a feel for pain points that needed to 
be solved by the new MVC clientside frameworks.

It uses a hand built controller, a thin model layer and is frankly a bit of a mess.

## Install and see it run

download [qedserver](http://qedserver.napcs.com/) , then install the repo in the server's public directory

run bower install to add the runtime dependencies

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html) and everything should be pretty 
self explanitory from there.
