webclient-mvc-examples
======================

Example code from my explorations of MV* webclient frameworks, which I'm discussing at [my blog](http://jamesgdriscoll.wordpress.com)

All code uses [QEDServer](http://qedserver.napcs.com) as the backend REST datasource

Currently consists of three exmaples:

* [a vanilla jQuery/bootstrap setup](https://github.com/netdance/webclient-mvc-examples/tree/master/vanilla-jQuery-MVC-sample)
* [A first use of Backbone](https://github.com/netdance/webclient-mvc-examples/tree/master/backbone-first-cut)
* [A first use of Backbone set up with Yeoman](https://github.com/netdance/webclient-mvc-examples/tree/master/backbone-yeoman), allowing me to explore Grunt, Require.js and other tools
